          <p>
            A UX project plan is your blueprint for how you're going to conduct UX activities. Not to be confused with the overall project plan (which is usually owned by a project manager or program manager), a UX project plan helps you think about how UX work will integrate with the broader project timelinem.

        <h3>Discuss The Project</h3>
        <p>
          Simply put, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed in order to reach a specific outcome. A project can also be defined as a set of inputs and outputs required to achieve a particular goal. Projects can range from simple to complex and can be managed by one person or a hundred. Projects are often described and delegated by a manager or executive. They go over their expectations and goals and it's up to the team to manage logistics and execute the project in a timely manner. Sometimes deadlines can be given or a time limitation. For good project productivity, some teams break the project up into individual tasks so they can manage accountability and utilize team strengths.

        <h3>Brainstorming ^ Concept</h3>
        <p>
          We often find that some project teams take brainstorming far too lightly, either not taking it seriously enough or by using ineffective methods, or in some cases skipping the process altogether. Effective brainstorming not only kicks a project into action, but it also helps to get everyone on the team involved and in the right frame of mind. Done correctly, it can set a project out on the right foot, bringing ideas to life, setting solid targets and goals, creating focus, and building energy and buzz. There are several means and methods for effective brainstorming and some will work better for different teams and projects than others. Despite this, there is a simple structure to brainstorming which everyone should aware of. Below is our collection of effective brainstorming tips.

        <h3>UI/UX Planning</h3>
        <p>
          Planning user experience (UX) projects is a balancing act of getting the right amount of user input within the constraints of your project. The trick is to work out the best use of your time. How can you get the most UX goodness for your clientâ€™s budget? This article explains how to choose the right mix of tools for the task at hand. The planning phase is all about understanding what you have been asked to do and working out the best combination of activities that will give you the outcome you need, within the time, budgetary and resource constraints of the project.

        <h3>Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          In statistics, an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables, and describes a situation in which the effect of one causal variable on an outcome depends on the state of a second causal variable (that is, when effects of the two causes are not additive).[1][2] Although commonly thought of in terms of causal relationships, the concept of an interaction can also describe non-causal associations. Interactions are often considered in the context of regression analyses or factorial experiments.
